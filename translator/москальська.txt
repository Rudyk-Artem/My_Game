Rules of the game:

Math Challenge is a game for two players. Players take turns placing chips on the playing field.
Above the player's field is written the random number of the D6 cube, which he will now place.
If several identical numbers are in a row, they are multiplied, for example here:


















4*4*4=64 and 6*6=36 , 2*2=4 because it is a series of identical numbers, but 3 is not multiplied here
because between them there is another chip, just added. In the example: 4*4*4+5+3+3+2+1+1=79 and
6*6+2*2+5+5+4+2=56 i.e. now the first player wins.

The one with more points wins, the game ends when one of the players fills the entire field.
